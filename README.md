Project Title:
HR Analytics Dashboard for Workforce Demographics, Attrition & Engagement Analysis

Short Description:
This Tableau-based HR Analytics Dashboard provides an interactive overview of workforce distribution, attrition trends, employee demographics, and job satisfaction levels. It empowers HR leaders to identify problem areas, optimize retention strategies, and make evidence-based workforce decisions.

Problem Statement:
Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations, leading to loss of experienced talent, higher recruitment costs, and decreased productivity. Without actionable insights into attrition drivers across departments, roles, education fields, and demographics, HR teams cannot design effective retention policies.

Goal of the Dashboard:
⦁	To track workforce distribution and attrition at multiple levels (department, age, gender, education).
⦁	To analyse job satisfaction patterns across job roles.
⦁	To provide actionable insights for retention strategies and employee engagement improvements.
⦁	To enable data-driven HR decision-making.

Steps Taken:
1.	Collected and cleaned HR data (employee demographics, attrition details, job roles, education fields, satisfaction levels).
2.	Designed key KPIs: Total Employees, Attrition Count, Attrition Rate, Active Employees, Average Age.
3.	Built visualizations for attrition by department, age group, education field, and gender.
4.	Incorporated job satisfaction matrix to analyze role-wise engagement.
5.	Deployed the dashboard in Tableau for interactive exploration by HR managers.

Walkthrough of Key Visuals:
⦁	Top Metrics (KPI Cards): Employee count (1,470), Attrition (237), Attrition Rate (16.12%), Active Employees (1,233), Avg. Age (37).
⦁	Department-wise Attrition (Pie Chart): Sales (56%) has the highest attrition, followed by R&D (39%), HR lowest (5%).
⦁	Employees by Age Group (Histogram): Majority workforce between 28–36 years, peaking at ages 30–33.
⦁	Education Field-wise Attrition (Bar Chart): Life Sciences (89) and Medical (63) fields dominate attrition.
⦁	Job Satisfaction by Role (Matrix): Displays satisfaction distribution (1–4) for different job roles. Sales Executives and Research Scientists show mixed satisfaction scores.
⦁	Attrition Rate by Gender & Age (Donut Charts): Younger employees (<25) and older employees (>55) show higher attrition rates compared to mid-age groups.

Key Insights:
⦁	Sales department is the most vulnerable with 56% attrition.
⦁	Life Sciences and Medical fields face the highest attrition by education.
⦁	Workforce is concentrated in ages 28–36, which is the organization’s core talent pool.
⦁	Job satisfaction scores are uneven, with certain roles showing lower engagement.
⦁	Younger (<25) and older (>55) employees show higher attrition rates compared to mid-career employees.

Business Impact:
⦁	Gives HR real-time visibility into workforce health and attrition trends.
⦁	Helps identify critical job roles, departments, and education backgrounds with high attrition.
⦁	Enables targeted retention programs for vulnerable employee groups.
⦁	Reduces hiring costs and productivity loss by addressing attrition proactively.
⦁	Improves employee engagement through data-backed interventions.
